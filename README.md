Multi-Cycle-CPU
==============

Consult the design document for a full breakdown of the functionality of this multi-cycle single ALU processor design. A test program is loaded into the generated memory, from a coe file. This can be modified using the instruction set detailed in the excel document, to make the processor perform new tasks.
